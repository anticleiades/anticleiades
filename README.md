### Ego Iulianus sum

âœ¨ Avid knowledge-seeker, citizen of the world, eclectic and creative student.

ðŸ‘€ Inquisitively delving into the foundations of Computer science from a 
_transdisciplinary_ point of view, with particular attention
to its mathematical, logical and philosophical roots.

ðŸ¦‰ Starting from a solid multidisciplinary (both humanistic and scientific) background, now BSc CS student @[UniPi](https://di.unipi.it/en/)

Some _fixed points_ I am in love with:
- (theoretical) computer science; 
- $\Theta = (\lambda x.\lambda y. y(x\ x\ y)))(\lambda x.\lambda y. y(x\ x\ y))$
- (computational and Indo-European) linguistics -> N(atural)L(anguage)P(rocessing);
- $Y = \lambda f.(\lambda x.f(x\ x))(\lambda x.f(x\ x))$
- logic; 
- latin;
- philosophy.
